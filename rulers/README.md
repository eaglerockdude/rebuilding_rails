# Rulers

This is a rails app packaged as a GEM so it can be plugged in.
Essentially it was an exercise to build a rails-like framwork from the ground-up
to get a better feel for how rails itself does what it does.



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rulers'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rulers
